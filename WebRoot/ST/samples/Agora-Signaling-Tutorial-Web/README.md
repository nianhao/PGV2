This repository will help you learn how to use Agora Signaling SDK to realize a simple chat web application, like wechat.

With this sample app, you can:

- Login signaling server
- Input another user's account and start a private chat
- Show your chat log
- Join group chats
- Send channel message, receive channel message
- Leave the group
- Logout

Agora Signaling SDK supports iOS / Android / Web. You can find demos of these platform here:

- IOS    : https://github.com/AgoraIO/Agora-Signaling-Tutorial-iOS-Swift
- Linux    : https://github.com/AgoraIO/Agora-Signaling-Tutorial-Linux
- MacOS  : https://github.com/AgoraIO/Agora-Signaling-Tutorial-macOS-Swift  
- Windows: https://github.com/AgoraIO/Agora-Signaling-Tutorial-Windows
- Java   : https://github.com/AgoraIO/Agora-Signaling-Tutorial-Java


## Running the App
First, create a developer account at [Agora.io](https://dashboard.agora.io/signin/), and obtain an App ID.
Then select the editor in the test project, click App Certificate, and get the App Certificate according to the operation.
Update "config.js" in the project root dir with your App ID and App Certificate.

``` javascript
const AGORA_APP_ID = 'abcdefg'

const AGORA_CERTIFICATE_ID = 'hijklmn'
```

Then put the file 'AgoraSig-*.js' you got under the path '/src/assets/vendor'. Run npm to install dependency and use gulp to publish dist

``` bash
# install gulp-cli for the first time
npm install gulp-cli -g
# install dependency
npm install
# generate dist
gulp build
```

A '/dist/' will be generated under the project root dir, warning: **do not use browser to directly open .html using file protocol, you must use http/https protocol**, that is to see you should deploy a server or use tools like Python simpleHTTPserver.

### About Token
You can provide an additional param 'token', usually generated by server and used as identity credential. It is ignored in default, you can rewrite 'login' function in signalingClient.js to enable it.

``` javascript
//... 
let session = this.signal.login(account,'_no_need_token');
//... 
```
